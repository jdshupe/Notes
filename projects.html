				<a href="rental maker/index.html">Rental Maker</a> - a small web
			app used to create bulk upload file for equipment POs.

				<p> Our equipment is tracked with month bills as individual lines on POs.
				So for a 12 month long rental, someone would enter 12 identical lines. 
				The efficiency of this decision can be argued but it was not in my
				control to change. Instead I created this took to take a single line
				item and create the upload lines for the entire duration. A PO that
				would be 20 or 30 lines entered by hand can now be done in just 1 or
				2 lines.  </p>

				<p> This tool created a labor savings of almost 2 weeks a year for
				myself and has been added to the workflow of multiple agents in our
				offices.</p>

				<a href="https://github.com/john-shupe-amteck/equipment-tracker">Equipment
					Dashboard</a> - a CLI interface written in C++ to act as a
				company dashboard for equipment rentals. 

				<p>The desire to create this arose after looking into our current 
				ERP's ability to track equipment and found that it was lacking 
				in many of the aspects that we desired. In the future, the tool
				is planned to include the following information.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Individual rental overview </li>
					<li>Utilization rates</li>
					<li>Display savings opportunities</li>
					<li>Company wide trends across all jobs</li>
				</ul>
