		<h2>Amteck LLC - Data Manager</h2>
		<p>Employment: 2023/07/05 - Present</p>

		<h2>Amteck LLC - Purchasing Agent</h2>
		<p>Employment: 2019/12/02 - 2023/07/05</p>
		<p>Job Responsibilities</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Purchase general and specialized equipment, materials, and
				subcontractor services for construction projects.</li>

			<li>Maintaining records of all transactions, purchase orders,

			<li>Approving invoices for materials and equipment rental.</li>
			<li>Track and maintain equipment for job sites.</li>
			<li>Daily communication with field and office personnel. </li>
			<li>Other duties as required. </li>
			<li>Analyzes company-wide data on purchasing, pricing trends, and
				overall project efficacy to increase productivity.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Contributions</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Created a new report inside the COINS ERP system to track
				purchased materials against budgeted materials. Pulled data from
				Purchasing, Accounts Payable, and Estimating in order to provide
				information on current qty purchased, overall qty budgeted, and
				outstanding/committed costs.</p>
				<p>In addition to the report itself, I created a SOP and Excel
				VBA macro to take exported budget information from our
				Estimating software, and process it to be bulk uploaded into the
				ERP. This saved Project Coordinators from having to format and
				upload by hand budgets that are up to 1000s of line items
				long.</p>
			</li><br>
			<li><p>Previously, all equipment POs were entered by hand by
				employees. This added up to a significant amount of time each
				day and rather large break in the normal flow of the job. To
				improve this process I created this <a href="rental maker/index.html">
					web app</a> that took this from a dreaded long process, to 
				quickly filling out a form and bulk uploading this into our ERP.
				</p>
				<p>Rental POs are now being entered into the system quicker and
				more efficiently. This lead to more accurate, up-to-date job
				cost reporting and correct invoicing.</p>
				<p>After seeing that the tool was useful to myself in my
				everyday work flow, I distributed it to the other purchasing
				agents across the company and let them use it as well. When last
				checked, it was saving almost 2 weeks of labor per year per
				agent. This opened up time for other, sometimes neglected, tasks
				to move up in the queue.</p>
			</li><br>
			<li>
				<p>The other task that was rather simple but very time heavy was
				entering purchase orders into the system. To streamline this
				process I used the Microsoft Power Automate platform. Now
				quotes are sent to a cloud hosted flow, processed by an AI
				model, and formatted into an excel file for bulk upload into the
				PO.</p>
				<p>The largest hurdle with this project was matching the vendor
				items up to our own internal item numbers. To accomplish this I
				implemented a very basic Reinforcement Learning process where
				the AI request further input from the user as needed to get the
				correct answer and then stores the answers provided for future
				use. This meant that even though the system started with no
				prior knowledge of our suppliers or our own inventory coding,
				the more it was used, the more capable it became. </p>
				<p>Now, a few months into using this system, the majority of POs
				from our top tier vendors can be keyed without a person ever
				opening the quote.</p>
