# main loop
- head out of the main area, into a tile dungeon
- have to gamble appropriately to go out, get resources, and make it back
## home area
- tiled zone with room for all future buildings and resources
- rebuilding each shop or utility will open the opportunity for certain upgrades
- this is where all powering up happens
- need a lore reason why this is the only healing zone
- eventual passive gathering of some items should be allowed
    - ingredients for potions
    - food
    - basic gear and clothing possibly
## dungeon area
- use day/night cycle to toggle difficulty of encounters and encourage short expeditions instead of multi day trips
- fully surrounds the home area
- can be entered from the 4 cardinal directions
- the farther out, the harder the encounter but he better the rewards
- each room has a random layout, enemies, and enemy number
- needs to be scalable with the number of players
- loot must be carried by the players and the methods of carrying it can be upgraded

- GOAL: at the outer range of the dungeon there is a room with a harder fight protecting an exit portal
### player death
- if players die in the maze, teammates can take their stuff home
- once a player dies, there is a random chance on the next excursion that you will find the room they died in
