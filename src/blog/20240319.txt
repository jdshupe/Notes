Growing without the proper support/resources is a monumental task. I have been placed in a position for which I am lacking knowledge, experince, and motivation.  On top of this, everyone else seems to think I am performing beyond expectations. The issues is, I know that they don't know wwhat they want and as long as I can seem busy enough, they will be pleased.
I tend to knock College as an overrated institution that doesn't provide people with the tools necessary for the job field. The fact of the matter is it gives them the ability to be plugged into a position with a base understanding of what they are required to perform. I am writing my own job description as well as the guidelines for the entire company and I don't have anyone who's input I value steering me.
A ship with no rudder can still move at full speed in whatever direction the wind and the waves are moving it but without someone on the tiller to point it towards the destination, the chances of making it there are slim.
